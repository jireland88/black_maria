# Black Maria

This project is an investigation into the card game that has been the focal point of many family evenings - Black Maria. Here there is code to simulate it as well as my attempts at pitting different players at various skill levels to calculate effectiveness.

Reason for existance - wanted to know the standard deviation of the game score.
